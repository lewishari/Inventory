    <p> Hari, you can do anything! This is just a beginning, Rock it!! Some general information about the site maybe? A counter maybe? Anything you want that isn't supposed to be housed in the content area to the left of this paragraph, stick it here, or in under another header underneath this one - the choice is yours. </p>

    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p> Hello and welcome to Stepping Stone, another web template designed by James Koster. The inspiration for this template came from some really nice photographs of objects on white surfaces that I saw earlier today. I took a look around for something to photograph to get this effect and decided to use this stone. From there I decided that the template would extremely light and easy on the eyes - trying to uphold the feel of this photograph. </p>
    <p> Another nice feature of this template is the ability to change the image at the top to somethign more suiting to your site (your logo maybe), whilst still keeping the overall feel of the page. I find that alot of web templates are too reliant on the images they contain and thus only appeal to a small market. I try to make my templates uable by anyone. </p>
    <h1>CSS &amp; XHTML</h1>
    <p> As anyone looking for a website template to use would expect - this template is of course, both CSS and XHTML valid according to the w3c. The benfits of this include; </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The website rendering correctly in a wide range of browser platforms</li>
      <li>Since CSS is used to maximise the aesthetics of the website the load times are extremely low making for an extremely excessable website.</li>
      <li>Low use of images saves bandwidth and improves load times</li>
    </ul>
    <p> For more information regarding this, and lots of other usefull web design related stuff, follow this link. </p>
